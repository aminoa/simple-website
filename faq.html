            <dt>Why does this website look so plain?</dt>
            <dd>I originally had a more visually appealing Hugo website (found <a href="https://github.com/aminoa/personal-website">here</a>) but I found using a premade theme made my website look too samey and soulless. I do plan on eventually revamping this website
            to look more interesting/interactive but I currently don't have the time to work on this; therefore, I chose (mostly) plain HTML to quickly get up a simple and maintainable site.</dd>
